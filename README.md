# code snippets
This is the function I came up with to dynamically generate html elements to display the data from objects within my array of questions. I assign attributes because I need to be able to access the users choice for comparison in a different function.
```
function changeQuestion() {
  startCountdown();
  $("#question").empty();
  $("#answers").empty();
  $("#question").html(allQuestions[index].q);
  
  for (var i = 0; i < allQuestions[index].p.length; i++) {
      var newAnswerDiv = $("<div>");
      newAnswerDiv.attr("data-name", allQuestions[index].p[i]);
      newAnswerDiv.attr("class", "possible-answer");
      newAnswerDiv.text(allQuestions[index].p[i]);
      $("#answers").append(newAnswerDiv);
      console.log(newAnswerDiv);
    }
}
```


# Learning points
This project had a lot of learning opportunities. When I wrote out my psuedo-code, I thought the logic was going to be pretty straight-forward. Once I coded out my psuedo-code I realized it was going to have a lot of redundancy to be functional. I tried to eliminate as much as I could which led me to completely eliminating some of the functions I had initially thought would be usefully compartmentalized. I was still left with a lot of emptying, hiding, showing of elements. This was also my first time styling elements generated by JQuery which had it's own challenges.
